## 🚀 Key Features

* **End-to-End Testing:** Executed comprehensive manual testing for a live e-commerce platform, focusing on high-traffic modules including **User Authentication** and **Product Search**.
* **Test Design & Execution:** Authored and executed **15+ detailed test cases** covering positive, negative, and edge-case scenarios, resulting in the identification of **8+ functional defects**.
* **Requirement Traceability:** Developed and maintained a **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**, ensuring 100% alignment between functional specifications and test execution.
* **Defect Management:** Documented high-quality bug reports with clear reproduction steps and screenshots, managing the **Defect Life Cycle** to ensure 100% resolution of critical issues.
* **Database Validation:** Performed **Backend Testing using MySQL** to verify data integrity for new user registrations and accurate search result counts.
* **Regression & Stability:** Reduced potential production issues by performing **Smoke and Regression testing** after bug fixes, ensuring zero impact on existing features.
